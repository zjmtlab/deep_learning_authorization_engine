# deep_learning_authorization_engine

This is a simply demo show deep learning can learn the simply authorization policies from training data. Then evaluate the test input and output correct grant/deny result.

This demo is different from ordinary deep learning use case because we want the training data cover all the policies the model want to learn, that means the test data is a subset of training data. I know one rule of deep learning is don't use the test data to train your model, but this demo is just want give a possibility that deep learning can work as a authorization engine, is just for fun, let's take it easy.

python deep_learning_authorization_engine.py
